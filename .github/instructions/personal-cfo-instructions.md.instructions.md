# Personal CFO – Development Instructions

These instructions are always loaded and must be followed:

- `.github/instructions/personal-cfo-instructions.md.instructions.md` (this file)
- `.github/instructions/AGENTS.md` (additional blueprint and design rules kept in lockstep with this file)

**Simplicity, speed, premium feel.**

- Clean layouts, subtle shadows, micro-animations
- Benefit-driven copy (clear > clever)
- Every screen answers: "What can I do here?"
- Landing includes Pricing and CTA before footer
- Shipping mindset: MVP first, iterate fast, keep type-safety high

## Monitoring & Logging

- **Error Tracking:** Vercel Analytics + Sentry (optional for production)
- **Logs:** Structured JSON logs with levels (info, warn, error)
- **Metrics:** Track statement upload success/failure rates, AI extraction latency, user signup/login events
- **No console.log in production:** Use `lib/logger.ts` for structured logging

## Security & Compliance

- **HTTPS only** (enforced via Vercel)
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Restrict inline scripts, allow only trusted domains
- **CORS:** API routes allow same-origin only; adjust for mobile app later
- **SQL Injection Prevention:** Use parameterized queries only (Supabase handles this)
- **Rate Limiting:** Max 10 uploads/minute per user, max 100 API requests/minute per user (configurable via middleware)
- **Input Validation:** Zod schemas on all API inputs
- **RLS Everywhere:** No user data accessible without proper `user_id` policy
- **No PDF Storage:** PDFs deleted immediately after processing to avoid storing sensitive financial data
- **Password Reset:** Admins can reset to default `PersonalCFO2025!`, users can change via Settings

## API Versioning

- **v1 Routes:** All current routes are implicitly v1
- **Future Versions:** Prefix with `/api/v2/*` when breaking changes needed
- Keep v1 stable; add new fields/endpoints to v2 as neededor failed statements (max 2 retries total)
- **Plan checks:** enforce monthly limit on `free` (2/month); unlimited on plus/pro/admin
- **Rate limiting:** Max 10 uploads per minute per user (configurable)

**AI Extraction & OCR Edge Cases**

- Detect encrypted/locked PDFs → `status='failed'`, `failure_reason='encrypted'`; show guidance and "retry with external script" path when you provide it.
- Detect text prefix artifacts → strip/sanitize before parsing.
- Low-confidence/empty extraction → `status='failed'` with reason; metadata remains for re-try via retry button.
- **PDFs are NOT stored:** Files processed in memory/temp during extraction, then immediately deleted. Only metadata (file name, upload date, status, failure reason) persists in `statements` table.)
- `.github/instructions/AGENTS.md` (additional blueprint and design rules kept in lockstep with this file)

## Product Snapshot

**Name:** Personal CFO
**Domain:** personal-cfo.io
**Tagline:** Track your money. See patterns. Act smarter.

Personal CFO helps users improve personal finances. Users upload **PDF bank statements**, the system extracts transactions (AI), categorizes via **user-defined keyword rules**, and surfaces **budgets, alerts, and analytics**. Email verification is handled by **Supabase**.

**CRITICAL SECURITY NOTE:** PDFs are **NOT stored permanently**. Files are processed in memory/temp storage during extraction, then immediately deleted. Only metadata (file name, upload date, status) is persisted in the `statements` table to avoid handling sensitive user financial documents.

## Architecture Overview

**Stack:** Next.js 15 (App Router) + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage) + Celery & Redis (async jobs; a Supabase-native queue alternative is acceptable)

- **Frontend:** Next.js App Router (client components under `app/`) + Tailwind + shadcn/ui (Radix primitives)
- **UI Components:** Only from `@/components/ui/*` (tokenized; CSS variables)
- **Backend:** Next.js Route Handlers (`app/api/*`), Edge where appropriate (public resources), background jobs via **Celery** (PDF parsing, AI extraction, re-categorization)
- **Database:** Supabase Postgres with **Row Level Security** on every user table
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth (email/password + magic links) with **email verification enabled**
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage for statement PDFs
- **Queue:** Redis (broker/result backend) for Celery workers (or Supabase-native queue)
- **i18n:** en/es; toggle in Settings; strings come from dictionaries (no hardcoded UI text)
- **Currencies:** ISO-4217 support (min: PEN, USD, EUR) with amounts stored as integer minor units (`amount_cents`) + `currency`

## Plans, Pricing & Entitlements (v1, USD)

**Plan types (enum):** `free`, `plus`, `pro`, `admin`
**Billing (monthly, USD):** Free $0.00, Plus $19.99, Pro $49.99. Admin is internal and not billable.

**IMPORTANT:** Stripe integration is planned but account is pending approval. For v1, implement a **"Join Waiting List"** flow that creates a free account. Payment and plan upgrades will be enabled later.

**Entitlements Matrix**

- **free**

  - Cards: 1
  - Statements per month: 2
  - Categories: 6 preset (first 6 are system-created and cannot be deleted; user cannot add more)
  - Alerts: 2
  - Budgets: 2
  - Keyword categorization: enabled

- **plus**

  - Cards: 5
  - Statements per month: unlimited
  - Categories: up to 25 custom (first 6 system categories + up to 19 user-created)
  - Alerts: 6
  - Budgets: 10
  - Keyword categorization: enabled

- **pro**

  - Cards: unlimited
  - Statements per month: unlimited
  - Categories: unlimited (first 6 system categories + unlimited user-created)
  - Alerts: 10
  - Budgets: 15
  - Keyword categorization: enabled

- **admin**

  - Cards/statements/categories/alerts/budgets: unlimited
  - Access to **Admin Panel**
  - Can reset user passwords (to default), deactivate/activate accounts, view system health and job queues

**Enforcement**

- Entitlements are enforced in **server** code (never trust client) via `lib/plan.ts` helpers invoked inside API route handlers prior to writes.
- Monthly statement usage for `free` is tracked with a `statements_monthly_usage` materialized view or a `COUNT(*)` query scoped to current calendar month; deny with 402-style app error.
- Category counts and budgets/alerts counts enforced by totals per user.
- **Plan downgrades:** When downgrading (e.g., Pro → Plus or Free), user-created categories beyond the limit are **deactivated** (marked `status='inactive'`). The first 6 system categories remain untouched and active. No grace periods.
- RLS still applies; these checks are **in addition** to RLS.

## Core Entities

### User

- `id` (UUID, PK)
- `email` (unique)
- `created_at`
- `plan` (enum: "free", "plus", "pro", "admin")
- `plan_start_date`
- `timezone` (string, default: "America/Lima" for Peru UTC-5, user-configurable in Settings)
- `primary_currency` (string, default: "PEN" for Peruvian Soles)

### Bank

- `id` (UUID, PK)
- `name` (string)
- `logo_url` (optional)
- `brand_color` (optional, hex)
- **Pre-seeded banks:** BCP, Interbank, BBVA, Scotiabank, Diners Club, Mibanco, Caja Piura, Caja Arequipa, Caja Huancayo, Banco Pichincha, and "Other" for custom entries

## Key Data Flow (Happy Paths)

1. **User uploads statement (PDF)** → `/dashboard` → **Statements** → `POST /api/statements`
   File uploaded to temp storage (processed in memory) → create `statements(status='processing')` → enqueue background job → **PDF deleted immediately after extraction** → only metadata persists.

2. **Background AI extraction** (async job)
   Fetch PDF from temp → robust extraction (handles locked PDFs, MIME validation, text prefix stripping) → **ASK DIEGO FOR PROMPT** → parse transactions → categorize via keywords/excluded keywords (first match wins; excluded keywords mark as Uncategorized) → bulk insert into `transactions` with `statement_id` → mark `status='completed'` or `status='failed'` with `failure_reason`. **Max 2 retries** via retry button in UI.

3. **Transactions available**
   User sees Transactions table with filters/sorting; can add/edit/delete manually.
   Manual transactions have `statement_id = NULL`.
   Deleting a **statement** cascades: deletes its transactions.
   Editing transactions is allowed post-creation (no audit trail in v1).

4. **Budgets, Analytics & Alerts**

   - **Budgets:** current **calendar month** progress bars; resets on 1st of each month.

- **Analytics:** 3 charts (6-month fixed window, non-exportable in v1) with **currency toggle** (PEN/USD/EUR minimum). Exchange rates: Primary https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/${NEXT_PUBLIC_EXCHANGERATE_API_KEY}/latest/PEN with fallback https://api.exchangerate.fun/latest?base=PEN. Implement retry/fallback logic and short-term caching (e.g., 1-hour TTL) in `lib/currency.ts`.
- **Alerts:** v1 supports threshold/rule-based notifications (budget overrun, unusual spikes). Alerts are calculated **real-time** and displayed as cards in the dashboard. Alert events stored in `alert_notifications` table for future use.

5. **Keywords & Categories**
   Users maintain categories, keywords (bulk CRUD), and excluded keywords.
   If a transaction matches both a category keyword AND an excluded keyword, it's marked as **Uncategorized**.

## Next.js 15 Dynamic Routes

Use **async params** only:

```
// ✅ Next.js 15
export async function GET(
  request: Request,
  props: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }
) {
  const { id } = await props.params
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ ok: true }))
}
```

Examples: `app/api/transactions/[id]/route.ts`, `app/api/statements/[id]/route.ts`.

## Client Components & Hooks

Any page using `useAuth`, `useState`, `useRouter`, or domain hooks must be a **client component**:

```
"use client"
import { useAuth } from "@/hooks/use-auth"
import { useTransactions } from "@/hooks/use-transactions"
```

Key pages:
`app/(main)/dashboard/page.tsx`, `app/(main)/transactions/page.tsx`, `app/(main)/statements/page.tsx`, `app/(main)/budgets/page.tsx`, `app/(main)/analytics/page.tsx`, `app/(main)/settings/*`, `app/(main)/admin/*`.

## Supabase Client Usage

- **Browser:** `lib/supabase-browser.ts` → uses `process.env["NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL"]` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- **Server/API:** `lib/supabase.ts` → uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for privileged ops (never ship to browser)
- **Never** import `lib/env.ts` in browser code

## Authentication, Email Verification & Route Protection

1. Supabase **email verification required** (sign-in flows enforce verified email before granting access).
2. `middleware.ts` protects `/dashboard`, `/transactions`, `/statements`, `/analytics`, `/budgets`, `/settings`, `/admin`.
3. Unauthed → redirect to `/login?redirect=<path>`.
4. `useAuth` manages session client-side.
5. API routes require `requireAuth()` from `lib/auth.ts` (server validation + RLS alignment).

## Modules & UX Contract

### 0) Dashboard

- Welcome header with user’s name
- Cards summary, **Alerts** summary, Budgets snapshot, Monthly expenses summary, Recurrent services summary, Recent transactions (last 5–10)

### 1) Cards

- List user cards (table or grid)
- Create/edit/delete card
  Fields: `name`, `bank_id` (preseeded banks dropdown), `due_date` (optional)
- **Plan checks:** creating beyond entitlement returns app error with upgrade CTA

### 2) Transactions

- Table columns: Description (description + merchant), Transaction date, Category, Card, Currency, Amount
- Filters: from date, to date, category, card, currency
- Sorting on all sortable columns
- Bulk select + delete
- Manual add fields: type (income/expense), merchant, amount, currency, category, transaction_date, card, description
- Re-categorize one/many (same engine as statements)

### 3) Statements

- Table: file name, card, status (completed | failed | processing), upload date, file type
- Upload PDF linked to a card
- Re-categorize one/many statements
- Delete one/many statements → cascade delete their transactions
- **Plan checks:** enforce monthly limit on `free`; unlimited on paid/admin

**AI Extraction & OCR Edge Cases**

- Detect encrypted/locked PDFs → `status='failed'`, `failure_reason='encrypted'`; show guidance and “retry with external script” path when you provide it.
- Detect text prefix artifacts → strip/sanitize before parsing.
- Low-confidence/empty extraction → `status='failed'` with reason; file remains for re-try.

### 4) Analytics

- Chart A: Category Trends (year) – line chart Jan–Dec per category
- Chart B: Monthly spend (last 6 months, **fixed window**) + YTD total
- Chart C: Expenses per category (current month) – bar
- **Currency toggle** for all charts (PEN/USD/EUR minimum) with **one currency displayed at a time**
- **Exchange rates:** Use the following providers in order:
  - Primary: `https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/${NEXT_PUBLIC_EXCHANGERATE_API_KEY}/latest/PEN`
  - Fallback: `https://api.exchangerate.fun/latest?base=PEN`
  - Implement retry/fallback and cache exchange rates (1-hour TTL) in `lib/currency.ts`
- **No export** functionality in v1 (CSV/PNG export planned for later)

### 5) Budgets

- Card list (not table); each shows **current-month utilization** (progress bar / %), category, allocated amount, spent, remaining
- **Plan checks:** enforce max budgets per plan

### 6) Alerts (v1)

- Rules:

  - Budget Overrun (category monthly spend ≥ threshold)
  - Unusual Spike (daily spend > rolling avg × factor)

- Delivery: **in-app notifications displayed as cards in the dashboard** (v1)
- Alerts are evaluated **real-time** (on transaction create/update)
- Alert events stored in `alert_notifications` table (id, user_id, alert_id, triggered_at, message, read_at) for future email/push notifications
- Management: list, create, enable/disable, delete
- **Plan checks:** enforce max alerts per plan

### 7) Settings (tabs)

- Appearance: card color style (default palette vs bank colors)
- Categories: table (category, emoji, status, created at, actions); CRUD

  - **free**: 6 preset categories (system-created, cannot be deleted, cannot add more)
  - **plus/pro/admin**: 6 preset system categories (cannot be deleted) + custom categories up to plan limit (or unlimited)
  - On plan downgrade: user-created categories beyond new limit are set to `status='inactive'`; system categories remain active

- Keywords: select a category → table; bulk add (comma-separated), edit, delete; search
- Excluded keywords: list with add, bulk add, bulk delete
- Profile: name, last name, reset password, **timezone selector** (default: America/Lima UTC-5)
- i18n: language toggle (en/es), persisted per user in `profiles.locale`
- **Translations:** All UI strings from `locales/en.json` and `locales/es.json`; error messages also translated
- **Number formatting:** Always use `1,000.00` format (locale-aware thousands separator with 2 decimals)

### 8) Admin Panel (admins only)

- **User Management:**
  - View all users (table with email, plan, created_at, status)
  - Reset user password to default (`PersonalCFO2025!`)
  - Deactivate/activate user accounts
- **System Health:**
  - View job queue status (pending, processing, completed, failed counts)
  - Retry failed statement extraction jobs (shows job details: statement_id, user, failure reason, retry count)
- **Banks Management:**
  - CRUD banks (name, logo_url, brand_color)
  - View usage stats per bank
- No user impersonation in v1

## Data & RLS (Postgres snake_case)

Core tables:

- `users` (supabase auth user_id FK)
- `profiles` (user_id PK, name, last_name, is_admin boolean, locale string, timezone string, plan enum, primary_currency string)
- `plans` (code enum mirror, price_cents, currency, entitlements_json) — optional if you prefer static config
- `banks` (seeded; id, name, brand_color, logo_url)
- `cards` (id, user_id, bank_id, name, due_date, created_at)
- `statements` (id, user_id, card_id, file_name, status enum, uploaded_at, file_type string, failure_reason text, retry_count int default 0)
  - **Note:** No `file_path` column; PDFs are NOT stored permanently
- `transactions` (id, user_id, statement_id NULLABLE, card_id, description, merchant, transaction_date, category_id NULLABLE, currency, amount_cents, type enum, created_at, updated_at)
  - `statement_id` is NULL for manual transactions
  - Transactions can be edited post-creation (no audit trail in v1)
- `categories` (id, user_id, name, emoji, color, status enum 'active'|'inactive', created_at, is_preset boolean default false)
- `category_keywords` (id, user_id, category_id, keyword, created_at)
- `excluded_keywords` (id, user_id, keyword, created_at)
- `budgets` (id, user_id, category_id, amount_cents, currency, active boolean, created_at, period_start date, period_end date)
- `alerts` (id, user_id, rule_type enum, params_json jsonb, active boolean, created_at, last_triggered_at timestamp)
- `alert_notifications` (id, user_id, alert_id, triggered_at, message text, read_at timestamp NULL)

**RLS pattern:** each table with `user_id` → policy `auth.uid() = user_id`.
Admins: `profiles.is_admin = true` + plan `admin` for admin UI scope.

## Critical Patterns

### Validation with Zod

Validate inputs **before** DB ops:

- `lib/validators/cards.ts`
- `lib/validators/transactions.ts`
- `lib/validators/statements.ts`
- `lib/validators/categories.ts`
- `lib/validators/keywords.ts`
- `lib/validators/budgets.ts`
- `lib/validators/alerts.ts`

### Categorization Engine

`lib/categorization.ts`:

- Normalize text (strip prefixes/artifacts, lowercase, accent fold)
- Exclusion check → if matches, drop/flag
- Category match → first keyword hit wins (deterministic), tie-breakers supported
- Re-categorize supports single and bulk via job

### Async Jobs (Celery or Supabase Queue)

- Enqueue via `POST /api/jobs/*`; UI never talks to worker directly
- Idempotency keys for re-categorization and duplicate statement ingestion
- Retries with backoff for network/AI timeouts
- Tasks in `workers/` (separate service)

## Code Standards (Strict)

- **Files/folders:** kebab-case (e.g., `use-transactions.ts`)
- **Components:** PascalCase (`TransactionsTable`)
- **Functions/vars:** camelCase (`createBudget`)
- **DB:** snake_case (`user_id`)
- **TypeScript:** no `any` (`@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any: error`); prefer `type` over empty interfaces; domain types in `types/*.ts`
- **React/JSX:** escape apostrophes (`You&apos;re`); no `console.log` (use structured error util); loading/empty/error states for all async UI
- **Styling:** shadcn/ui only; centralized theme with tokens via CSS variables (colors, spacing, typography, radii, shadows); tokens MUST match `ui-references` colors exactly; no hardcoded hex; use `cn()` for class merging; accessible contrast; mobile-first (test at 360px)
- **UX:** clear IA; helpful empty states; light/dark via tokens (no hardcoded hex)

## Theme & Tokens

- Create and maintain a centralized theme with design tokens defined as CSS variables (colors, spacing, typography, radii, shadows, elevations, states).
- Implement the theme in `components/theme-provider.tsx` and expose a `ThemeToggle` via `components/theme-toggle.tsx`.
- Map the color tokens to the palettes shown in `ui-references/` exactly; do not approximate.
- Use shadcn/ui components exclusively and wire tokens via CSS variables; avoid inline styles and hardcoded hex values.
- Ensure dark and light modes are both fully tokenized and visually match the `ui-references` images.

## Routing Map (App Router)

Public:

- `/` (Hero, Value proposition, Pricing, CTA, Footer)
- `/login`, `/register`

Authed:

- `/dashboard`
- `/cards`
- `/transactions`
- `/statements`
- `/analytics`
- `/budgets`
- `/settings` (appearance, categories, keywords, excluded, profile, i18n)
- `/admin` (admins only)

API (examples):

- Cards: `POST /api/cards`, `PATCH /api/cards/[id]`, `DELETE /api/cards/[id]`
- Transactions: `GET /api/transactions`, `POST /api/transactions`, `PATCH /api/transactions/[id]`, `DELETE /api/transactions` (bulk via ids)
- Statements: `POST /api/statements` (pre-signed upload), `PATCH /api/statements/[id]/recategorize`, `DELETE /api/statements` (bulk)
- Analytics: `GET /api/analytics/overview`, `GET /api/analytics/trends`
- Budgets: `GET/POST/PATCH /api/budgets*`
- Settings: `GET/POST /api/settings/categories*`, `GET/POST /api/settings/keywords*`, `GET/POST /api/settings/excluded*`
- Alerts: `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/alerts*`

**API responses (consistent):**

```
{ "success": true, "data": { /* ... */ } }
{ "error": true, "message": "..." }
```

HTTP: 200/201, 400, 401, 404, 500.

## Development Workflow

### Commands

```
pnpm dev              # Start dev server (localhost:3000)
pnpm build            # Production build (must pass before commit)
pnpm run lint         # ESLint (strict)
pnpm test             # Vitest unit tests
```

### Pre-Commit Checklist

1. `pnpm run lint` → 0 errors
2. `pnpm build` → compiles
3. No unused imports, TODOs, or console.logs
4. Follow commit message format: `type(scope): description`
   - **type:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
   - **scope:** module name (e.g., `landing`, `auth`, `cards`, `theme`, `i18n`)
   - **description:** concise summary (imperative mood, lowercase, no period)
   - Examples:
     - `feat(landing): add conversion-focused hero section`
     - `fix(theme): correct dark mode border colors`
     - `docs(readme): update setup instructions`
     - `refactor(cards): extract card form to separate component`

### Backlog & TODO Tracking

- `TODO.md` is the **single source of truth** for features/bugs/chores.
- `CHANGELOG.md` tracks released features per version (e.g., v1.0.0, v1.1.0)
- Update both files in the **same PR** that implements changes.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` synchronized with rule/design changes done here.

### Commit Approval Policy

- Do **not** commit immediately after code changes.
- Post a short report (what changed + lint/build/test status + brief diff notes).
- Wait for explicit **Diego approval** before committing.
- **Split large changes into multiple focused commits:**
  - If changes span multiple modules/features, create separate commits per module
  - Each commit should be atomic and deployable
  - Example: Instead of one large "feat: add landing page and theme", split into:
    - `feat(theme): add CSS variable tokens and theme provider`
    - `feat(landing): create hero section with CTAs`
    - `feat(landing): add features section with emoji icons`
    - `feat(landing): implement pricing cards`
- Use descriptive commit messages following the format above
- Reference TODO items when applicable

### Branching & PR Hygiene

- Branch names: `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`
- PR must include: scope, screenshots for UI, verification checklist

## Database Migrations & Seeds

- All schema changes in `supabase/migrations/*.sql`
- **Never** modify production DB directly
- RLS enabled everywhere; owner checks via `user_id` and admin policies as needed
- Use **seed** scripts for banks and base categories

**Required Seeds (v1):**

- **Admin user:** create `admin@personal-cfo.io`, mark `profiles.is_admin = true` and `profiles.plan = 'admin'`.

- **Banks (pre-seeded for all users):**

  - BCP
  - Interbank
  - BBVA
  - Scotiabank
  - Diners Club
  - Mibanco
  - Caja Piura
  - Caja Arequipa
  - Caja Huancayo
  - Banco Pichincha
  - Other (custom)

- **Default categories for every new user (6 system categories):**

  1. Food (emoji: 🍔, color: orange, `is_preset = true`)
  2. Housing (emoji: 🏠, color: slate, `is_preset = true`)
  3. Transportation (emoji: 🚗, color: teal, `is_preset = true`)
  4. Income (emoji: 💵, color: indigo, `is_preset = true`)
  5. Entertainment (emoji: 🎮, color: purple, `is_preset = true`)
  6. Shopping (emoji: 🛒, color: blue, `is_preset = true`)

  - For **free** plan: these 6 are the ONLY categories allowed; user cannot add more.
  - For **plus/pro/admin**: these 6 cannot be deleted; users can add more up to plan limits (or unlimited).
  - System categories (`is_preset = true`) cannot be deleted or deactivated by plan downgrades.

- **Plans (if using table):** insert `free`, `plus`, `pro`, `admin` with USD pricing and entitlements JSON mirroring the matrix above.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit:** `tests/unit/` – categorization engine, currency utils, validators, date math, `lib/plan.ts` checks
- **Integration:** `tests/integration/` – API routes (transactions CRUD; statements upload → extract → persist; plan limits)
- **E2E (planned):** Playwright – upload→extract→transactions; budget progress; analytics charts + currency toggle; alerts fire; plan upgrade CTAs when limits reached
- No inline tests; all in `/tests`

## Design Philosophy

**Simplicity, speed, premium feel.**

- Clean layouts, subtle shadows, micro-animations
- Benefit-driven copy (clear > clever)
- Every screen answers: “What can I do here?”
- Landing includes Pricing and CTA before footer
- Shipping mindset: MVP first, iterate fast, keep type-safety high

## Role Expectations & Quality Bar

- **Copywriting:** senior-level; confident, crisp, helpful
- **UI:** FAANG-level FE/UX; accessible, responsive, tokenized
- **Logic:** senior backend; simple, robust, typed, observable

## Golden Rules

1. If unsure, ask — do not assume.
2. Update `TODO.md` after each implementation — before asking permission to commit.
3. Ask for permission before committing.
4. Take `ui-references` as reference for UI and colors. Colors must match the ones from the `ui-references`.

## Notes & Non-Negotiables

- Use **shadcn/ui** and theme tokens app-wide; no raw `text-white`, `bg-gray-*`, etc.
- Prefer reusable tokenized components; avoid style duplication.
- Statement parsing: **Before implementing AI extraction, ASK DIEGO FOR THE PROMPT.**
- Bulk destructive actions (statements/transactions) must show confirm modals and reflect cascading effects clearly.
- **Locked/Encrypted PDFs:** Detect and fail gracefully with actionable messaging; support retry via your external script when provided.
- **Email verification:** Enforced by Supabase prior to granting access to authed areas.
- **Plans & Enforcement:** all create/update APIs must call `lib/plan.ts` guards to enforce card/statement/category/alert/budget limits.
- **UI References:** Take `ui-references` as the canonical visual reference; UI colors must match those images exactly.
